Create a really nice web page using Tailwind CSS that uses the library "jsr:@hviana/multivariate-regression" (Do not use any dependencies other than Tailwind CSS). You can import the library directly into the page using ESM, with `import { ESNRegression } from "https://cdn.esm.sh/jsr/@hviana/multivariate-regression"`. Create modals to change parameters and instantiate the algorithm, save the algorithm state, load the algorithm state, and upload bulk training data (explain the upload format clearly) and predict. There should also be an modal to manually insert training data. The visualizations of the predictions should also be very attractive. Also explain in detail each parameter of the algorithm and how to optimize it for each case in the instantiation modal, with expandable explanations. There needs to be a reset option as well. Aways use JSON format to save/load/upload. Remember that the data can be n-dimensional, with many more than 3 dimensions for example, so create an appropriate visualization. It should also have the option to generate a random standard test. Besides being very beautiful, the page needs to be well-adapted for mobile devices. Furthermore, the model must be encapsulated in a worker, and its actions must have a loading indicator in the interface. Beware of visual clutter; integrate elements into well-organized menus with an expandable main menu. Here is the library's README:
